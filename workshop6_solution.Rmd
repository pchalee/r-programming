#### 1. Loop practice

**(a)** Write a function called `calculateRowMeans` that uses a **for loop** to calculate the row means of a matrix `x`.

```{r}
# calculateRowMeans computes the row means of a matrix x
# input: matrix x
# output: vector of length nrow(x) giving row means of x
calculateRowMeans <- function(x) {
  row.means <- numeric(nrow(x))
  for(i in 1:nrow(x)) {
    row.means[i] <- mean(x[i,])
  }
  row.means
}

```

**(b)** Try out your function on the random matrix `fake.data` defined below.

```{r}
set.seed(12345) # Set seed of random number generator
fake.data <- matrix(rnorm(500), ncol=5)
calculateRowMeans(fake.data)
```

**(b)** Use the `apply()` function to calculate the row means of the matrix `fake.data`

```{r}
apply(fake.data, MARGIN=1, FUN=mean)
```

**(c)** Compare this to the output of the `rowMeans()` function to check that your calculation is correct.

```{r}
identical(calculateRowMeans(fake.data), apply(fake.data, MARGIN=1, FUN=mean))
```
