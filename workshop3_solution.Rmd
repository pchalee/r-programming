#### 1. Data practice

In class we imported the survey data using the `read.table()` function. 

This is the code we used:

```{r}
survey <- read.table("survey_data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",") 
```

##### (a) How many survey respondents are from MISM or Other?

```{r}
sum(survey[["Program"]] == "MISM" | survey[["Program"]] == "Other")
```

##### (b) What % of survey respondents are from PPM?

```{r}
100 * sum(survey[["Program"]] == "PPM") / nrow(survey)
```

#### 2. Index practice

##### (a) Use $ notation to pull the OperatingSystem column from the survey data

```{r}
survey$OperatingSystem
```

##### (b) Do the same thing with [,] notation, referring to OperatingSystem by name

```{r}
survey[, "OperatingSystem"]
```

##### (c) Repeat part (b), this time referring to OperatingSystem by column number

```{r}
survey[, 3]
```
